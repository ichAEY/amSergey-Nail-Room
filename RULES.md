# TANEM Master Template — Rules v2

This repository is the single production template for individual masters. It is not a salon template and it never contains a real client site.

## Production boundary
- `Shablon-For-Only-Masters` stores only reusable layout, mechanics, validation and specialty rules.
- Real masters are created only in separate client repositories such as `TAN-xxxx`.
- Never insert a client's name, contacts, photos, services, reviews or business links into this template.
- A client repository is generated from the current stable template and then receives verified client data.

## Immutable visual policy
- Base colors, typography, spacing, cards, responsive behavior and overall visual language come from the approved Hair master design.
- Approved mechanics are taken only from `Shablon-Hair-Master`. Do not invent replacement mechanics when an approved Hair Master implementation already exists.
- Client data, photos, branding and unrelated blocks from reference sites must never be copied.
- Instagram links are never published.

## Specialty
- `hair`: mobile shows the approved Hair scissors/comb decoration; desktop does not.
- `nails`: mobile shows the approved animated nail palette; desktop does not.
- The Nails palette is positioned inside the hero with a stable reserved gap above the booking-action row, so client text length cannot push it into the CTA.
- Only specialties with an approved preset may be published. Currently approved: `hair` and `nails`.
- If the client's specialty does not match an approved preset, STOP the client build before changing client files. Do not use a generic mode, a similar preset, a neutral substitution or an improvised adaptation. Report that the current Master template does not support this specialty and that a separate approved preset is required.

## Hero copy
Hair is deterministic:
- heading: `<Имя> — ваш эксперт по волосам`;
- copy: `Стрижки, окрашивание, блонд, уход и укладки с вниманием к состоянию волос, оттенку и вашему образу.`

Nails is deterministic in the heading:
- heading: `<Имя> — ваш эксперт по маникюру и педикюру`;
- supporting copy may come from verified client data until a separate fixed Nails copy is approved.

Unsupported specialties are not built or published until a separate approved preset is added to this template.

## Intro
- Logo has priority when a real logo is supplied.
- Without a logo, intro/header use the text brand/master name fallback.
- Intro text is always centered.
- Long names automatically reduce in size and may wrap to two balanced lines instead of leaving the viewport.
- Never invent a logo.

## Portfolio
- Portfolio is a permanent structural section on both mobile and desktop.
- Missing client photos must not remove the Portfolio section or the hero link to it.
- The approved CTA wording is `Смотреть все работы`.
- The gallery control is always active. With zero client photos it opens the approved Hair Master gallery shell with no photographs inside.
- When the operator later uploads real client photos, the mobile and desktop gallery behavior remains the approved `Shablon-Hair-Master` behavior.
- Never invent, generate or download substitute client photos.

## Services
Every service uses one of the three approved Hair structures:
1. variants/subdivisions;
2. simple service with no description;
3. simple service with a description.

Categories:
- 1 visible category: no category switcher.
- exactly 2: two-button mode using the approved Hair Master tab mechanics; no synthetic `Все` tab.
- 3 or more: one Hair-style horizontal ribbon including `Все`; it never wraps to a second row. Overflow continues horizontally and is scrollable.
- Categories are dynamic and are never limited to four or five groups.

Many services:
- up to 7 services are shown immediately;
- from the 8th service onward, show the first 7 and the automatic `Открыть ещё N услуг` control;
- mobile and desktop use the same visible count and the same hidden count;
- the count is derived from the actual hidden items, never written by hand.

## About the master
The standard copy is written in first person and is deterministic. Only the master's first name is inserted into this standard lead.

Hair:
- unknown experience lead: `Я <Имя> — эксперт по волосам.`
- known experience lead: `Я <Имя> — эксперт по волосам со стажем более <N> лет.`
- paragraph 1: `Специализируюсь на стрижках и окрашивании, blond и сложных техниках, уходе и реконструкции волос.`
- paragraph 2: `Работаю с формой, цветом и состоянием волос, чтобы результат выглядел цельно и подходил именно вам.`
- skills: `Стрижки и окрашивание`; `Blond и сложные техники`; `Уход и реконструкция волос`.

Nails:
- unknown experience lead: `Я <Имя> — эксперт по маникюру и педикюру.`
- known experience lead: `Я <Имя> — эксперт по маникюру и педикюру со стажем более <N> лет.`
- paragraph 1: `Выполняю маникюр и педикюр, наращивание и коррекцию ногтей.`
- paragraph 2: `Работаю со стерильными инструментами и уделяю внимание аккуратности, форме и качеству результата.`
- skills: `Маникюр и педикюр`; `Наращивание и коррекция`; `Стерильные инструменты`.

The round monogram in About is mobile-only and always uses the first letter of the master's first name. Schedule, address and unrelated facts never enter the three skills.

## Experience
- Known experience: show the approved experience stat/badge and include it in the standard first-person About lead.
- Unknown experience: never invent it; omit the experience phrase, collapse hero stats to rating + service count and hide the empty experience badge.

## Languages
Russia:
- RU + EN.

Outside Russia:
- local country language + RU + EN.
- The mechanism is not country-hardcoded: use the verified local language code for Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Belarus, Moldova and other supported markets (for example `kk`, `uz`, `ky`, `hy`, `az`, `ka`, `be`, `ro`).
- Locale codes are normalized as lowercase language codes; the language switch label remains the short uppercase label supplied in `i18n.locales`.

Initial locale:
- saved visitor choice wins;
- otherwise use the first supported browser/system language;
- unsupported system language falls back to EN.

The selected locale is saved locally.

Content normalization:
- Russian is the canonical internal content language.
- Other enabled languages receive faithful, human-checked translations. Do not publish guessed or partial machine translation.
- Translate interface/navigation, headings, CTAs, standard template copy, master profession and descriptive copy, service categories/names/descriptions/variant labels, city/metro labels and schedule text.
- Translate complete dynamic phrases rather than stitching translated fragments together when word order can differ between languages.
- Brand/business names are identity data and are never translated.
- A master's personal name is never semantically translated. Keep the source spelling by default. A verified local spelling/transliteration may be supplied explicitly in `i18n.masterNames[locale]`; if it is absent, the original name is rendered.
- Review author, review text and review source are immutable source data and are always rendered verbatim in the original language.
- Phone numbers, URLs, booking/review provider names, prices/currency strings and exact street/address strings remain source data and are not translated. City/metro and explanatory location UI may be translated.
- A populated site fails validation if a required enabled-language translation is missing.

Layout:
- mobile language switch keeps the approved Esmeralda behavior immediately left of the menu;
- desktop language switch is visibly larger and sits immediately before the phone;
- the phone remains the rightmost desktop contact element.

## Additional
- Every master site shows exactly three compact standard cards in `Дополнительно`:
  - `Выбор услуги` — `Мастер поможет определиться.`
  - `Пожелания` — `Покажите пример результата.`
  - `Перенос записи` — `Предупредите заранее.`
- These three cards are template-owned defaults and are not replaced with schedules, addresses or invented client policies.
- On mobile, all three card titles use identical typography; no card may receive a smaller title size.

## Reviews
- Publish at most 9 verified five-star reviews from the supplied source, such as Yandex Maps or DIKIDI.
- Review structure on mobile and desktop follows `Shablon-Hair-Master`.
- Keep both approved review renderers: `mct-review-card-mobile` for widths below 1024px and `dct-review-card` for desktop. Both render the same verified review data; never remove one renderer while leaving the CSS split in place.
- Approved phone review layout: name with five stars on the left, review source on the right, up to 7 visible text lines, and `Подробнее →` fixed in the lower-right reserved area so review text can never overlap it. This rule is mobile-only; do not change the approved desktop review layout when applying it.
- Keep the real author, exact source and verbatim text of every review. Never summarize, rewrite, shorten, correct or fabricate review wording.
- Store `source` on an individual review when sources differ. A site-wide `reviewSource` may be used only when all published reviews come from the same source.
- Review cards always show five stars because only verified five-star reviews are allowed; do not add or infer a separate rating.
- If fewer than 9 verified reviews are available, publish only the verified reviews that exist.
- When there are no verified reviews, render no review section at all. Never use placeholder, sample or invented reviews.

## Booking and contact
- The booking block always uses: `Запишитесь онлайн или свяжитесь любым удобным способом.`
- Mobile booking/contact structure is frozen to the approved `TAN-0074` mobile `Запись и связь` block.
- Desktop booking/contact remains unchanged unless separately approved.
- The primary mobile booking CTA spans the full available action width.
- The live `Открыто / Закрыто` badge is shown at the right of `Запись и связь` and recalculates from the client's configured timezone and schedule data.
- When working hours differ by weekday, `location.weeklyHours` is the source of truth: define all seven keys `mon`…`sun`; a working day is `{ open: "HH:MM", close: "HH:MM" }`, and a day off is `null`. Never flatten a weekly schedule into one generic open/close pair. Legacy `openTime/closeTime` remains supported only when no weekly schedule is configured.
- A verified address and work schedule are displayed below the mobile contact actions as plain-text styling, never as a white card or separate route button.
- The displayed mobile address itself is clickable and opens the same verified route/map URL. If the source is Yandex Maps, keep the Yandex link; if the source is Google Maps, keep the Google link. Never substitute the provider or invent a route URL.
- The mobile location action uses that same verified route/map URL.
- When the location action is the unpaired final action on mobile, it spans the full contact-grid width.
- If a direct booking URL exists, generic booking CTAs open it.
- If a service-specific URL exists, that service opens its own URL.
- Otherwise the service inherits the direct booking URL when one exists.
- Without a direct booking URL, booking CTAs use the approved contact sheet.
- Phone alone is a valid contact configuration; messenger is optional.
- `contacts.channels` may contain multiple verified contact channels (for example WhatsApp, Telegram and VK). They render after the phone in the supplied order.
- Legacy `contacts.messenger` remains supported for existing TAN-xxxx sites and is deduplicated against `contacts.channels`.
- The booking/contact grid renders every verified channel dynamically; its existing paired/full-row layout logic must not be hard-coded to a fixed number of contacts.
- Never invent a booking URL, phone or messenger.
- Never expose Instagram as a booking/contact option.

## Canonical media contract
The same naming standard is used for every individual master.

- `hero.webp` — the main master photo. It is the hero image on mobile and desktop. Site-level hero is mandatory.
- `profile.webp` — a second master photo for the “О мастере” block. A client-supplied profile photo is optional.
- `gallery-01.webp`, `gallery-02.webp` ... `gallery-15.webp` — real works of the master. Production sites use at least one and at most 15 gallery images.
- `logo.webp`, `logo.png`, `logo.svg` or another suitable transparent logo file — optional. Never invent a logo.
- File names are lowercase. New sites do not introduce `master.00000.webp`, `masterpc.00000.webp`, `portrait` or other competing client naming schemes.

The operator uploads only real client media. In `site-data.mjs`, use `images.hero` for `hero.webp`, `images.profile` for `profile.webp`, and `images.gallery` for the numbered gallery files.

## Master photo fallback
Fallback files are template-owned system assets. The technical specialist never creates, downloads or copies them into a client package.

Approved paths:
- Hair: `public/fallback/masters/hair/hero.webp` and `public/fallback/masters/hair/profile.webp`.
- Nails: `public/fallback/masters/nails/hero.webp` and `public/fallback/masters/nails/profile.webp`.

Decision rules:
- Real `hero.webp` exists → use it.
- Real `hero.webp` is missing → use the fallback hero for the selected specialty.
- Real `profile.webp` exists → use it in “О мастере”.
- Real `profile.webp` is missing → use the fallback profile for the selected specialty.
- Real client media always has priority over fallback media.
- Hair fallback is never used for Nails and Nails fallback is never used for Hair.
- Unsupported specialties never reach media fallback selection: the build must already have been stopped by the Specialty rule.

## System favicon
- `favicon-source.png` is the canonical TANEM system identity icon, not a client logo.
- The served copy is `public/favicon-source.png`; it is used by browser/system favicon metadata.
- A technical specialist does not prepare or replace the favicon for each client.
- Client `logo.*` is rendered only inside the site and never replaces the TANEM system favicon unless a separate rule is explicitly approved.

## Mass-production quality gate
Before a template version becomes stable, rendered QA must cover at least:
- Hair with 3+ categories;
- Nails with exactly 2 categories and the mobile palette;
- empty gallery while Portfolio remains present;
- long master name;
- many services with automatic hidden count;
- RU/EN desktop header;
- direct booking;
- phone-only contact.

Only a green tested template version may be used to generate new `TAN-xxxx` repositories.
